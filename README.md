# K-Lang Blog

As a learner of the Korean language, I decided to build a blog to help me track and share what I am learning at the moment.
This was an experiment in the 'JAM Stack' paradigm, and I used the Contentful api to provide posts to be consumed by the front-end React app.
The major challenge I overcame was getting used to the Contentful platform: how to structure content models and how to use the api to effectively consume them.
